# ICAP Website Security Assessment (Initial Setup)

**Date:** July 26, 2025  
**Project:** ICAP Public Website  
**Prepared for:** Bank Cybersecurity Review

---

## 1. Project Overview
- **Frontend:** React (Vite, TypeScript)
- **Backend:** Strapi (Node.js, SQLite for dev, PostgreSQL for prod)
- **Hosting:** Self-hosted or bank-approved server
- **Purpose:** Public informational website (English/Arabic, articles, products, promos, etc.)

---

## 2. Security Measures (Current Setup)
- **HTTPS enforced** for all public and admin traffic
- **Strapi Admin Panel** protected by strong passwords and unique JWT secrets (stored in `.env`)
- **CORS** configured to only allow requests from the frontend domain
- **Backups:** Database and uploads are backed up daily
- **Dependencies:** All software and libraries are kept up to date
- **Access Control:** Only authorized users can access the Strapi admin panel
- **No public write access** to the API (read-only for public endpoints)

---

## 3. Folder Organization (Future-Proof for Security)

```
icap-platform/
├── backend/           # Strapi project (this repo)
│   ├── config/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── public/
│   ├── database/
│   ├── .env           # Not committed to git
│   └── ...
├── frontend/          # React project (separate repo or folder)
│   ├── src/
│   ├── public/
│   ├── .env           # Not committed to git
│   └── ...
└── docs/              # Documentation (security, architecture, etc.)
    ├── SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md
    ├── CYBERSECURITY_COMPLIANCE.md (future)
    └── ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md (future)
```

- **Separation of frontend and backend** makes it easy to add security layers (WAF, DMZ, etc.) later.
- **Documentation folder** for all security and compliance docs.
- **Environment variables** are never committed to git.

---

## 4. Planned Security Enhancements (If Required by Bank)
- Add **rate limiting** to API endpoints
- Restrict Strapi admin access by IP or VPN
- Add **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** in front of both apps
- Switch to **PostgreSQL** with encryption at rest for production
- Enable **audit logging** and monitoring
- Regular **security audits** and dependency updates

---

## 5. Summary
- The current setup is secure for a public website and ready for bank review.
- The folder structure and documentation make it easy to add more security later, with minimal restructuring.
- All sensitive data and secrets are protected and not exposed in version control.
