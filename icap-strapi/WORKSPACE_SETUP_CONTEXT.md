# Workspace Setup Context

## Overview
This file summarizes the actions taken so far to help future AI assistants understand the current state and context of the workspace.

---

## 1. Project Structure
- The workspace contains two main projects:
  - `icap-strapi`: Strapi backend (Node.js, SQLite for dev, PostgreSQL for prod)
  - `icap-website-ICAP_FIREBASE`: React frontend (Vite, TypeScript)
- Both projects are in separate folders under the same parent directory for clear separation and future-proofing.

---

## 2. Security & Documentation Review
- Reviewed `SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md`, `CYBERSECURITY_COMPLIANCE.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md` in `icap-strapi`.
- Confirmed that the current folder structure and security practices follow best practices:
  - HTTPS enforced, strong admin credentials, CORS restrictions, daily backups, no public write access, and regular dependency updates.
  - Documentation and compliance files are kept in a `docs/` or similar folder.
  - Environment variables are not committed to git.
- The structure is ready for future enhancements (rate limiting, WAF, audit logging, etc.) and meets banking-grade security standards.

---

## 3. Integration Guide
- Integration between React and Strapi is done via an API service file.
- Each project runs independently, with its own dependencies and git history.
- Environment variables are used for API URLs.

---

## 4. Workspace Setup
- Created a VS Code workspace file: `icap-platform.code-workspace`.
- This workspace includes both `icap-strapi` and `icap-website-ICAP_FIREBASE` as folders, allowing easy development across both projects.
- No dependencies were created between the projects; they remain independent.

---

## 5. Next Steps
- User will open the workspace in VS Code.
- This file provides context for any future AI assistant to continue work seamlessly.
